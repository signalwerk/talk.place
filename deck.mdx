# Simple Schema


```js
const card = {
  uuid: String,       // ← ID for mutations
  deleted: Boolean,   // ← Used to tell others to delete the card
  session: String,    // ← = Hash in URL
  text: String,       // ← Content
  color: Number,      // ← 🏳️‍🌈
  x: Number,          // ← Position
  y: Number           // ← Position
}
```


---
# URL holds it together

```
domain.xyz/board/?id=RftPD3Go
```

---
# Atomized mutations

```js
const mutation = [{
  type: 'card',   // ← type of mutation
  uuid: '...',    // ← card to update
  x: 15,          // ← New position
  y: 48           // ← New position
}]
```
---
# Atomized mutations

* Person *A* can **move** the card
* Person *B* can **change color** of the same card
* But **not two** can edit the same (last wins)
* Operational Transformation would be needed for multi-user edit


---
# K.I.S.S.

* *Server* listens to mutations and **updates DB**
* *Client* listens to mutations and **updates store**
* *Client* gets for **initial fetch** all Data as **mutations**

---
# Server · Take away

* **Two days** to setup a real-time digital whiteboard *is short*
* Frontend-Framework *mutations* on a store are like sending them to all «connected stores» via server
